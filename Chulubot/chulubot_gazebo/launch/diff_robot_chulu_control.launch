    The controller_spawner node starts the two wheel/joint position controllers for the robot by running a python script that makes a service call to the ros_control controller manager. The service calls tell the controller manager which controllers you want. It also loads a third controller that publishes the joint states of all the joints with hardware_interfaces and advertises the topic on /joint_states.

    A robot_state_publisher node simply listens to /joint_states messages from the joint_state_controller then publishes the transforms to /tf. This allows you to see your simulated robot in Rviz as well as do other tasks.
